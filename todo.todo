New Features:
    ☐ Make it so tanks will only shoot if it can see the player. 

Bugs:
    ☐ The player's activeBuls sometimes doesn't get reset when his bullets are destroyed. 
        It seems like that when a bullet from the computer player tank collides with a bullet from the player, it doesn't tell the player that his bullet got destroyed for some reason. 
    
Low Priority Tasks:
    ☐ Make a better way to randomize computer player tank shooting. 
    ☐ Add the bullet path line from the player's position to the mouse position.
